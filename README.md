# SQL2SHACL

SQL2SHACL implements the constraint rewriting proposed in the paper "A Source-to-Target Constraint rewriting for Direct Mapping" by Ratan Bahadur Thapa and Martin Giese [[1]](#1).

## General

- SQL2SHACL is in principle non-validating, meaning the user has to take care providing correct SQL syntax
- The intention is to provide hints when
    - expressions are skipped due to containing wrong syntax
    - important information is missing (e.g. missing data type for column)

### Supported SQL constraints

The following column and table constraints are supported:
- NOT NULL
- UNIQUE
- PRIMARY KEY
- REFERENCES

Caviats:
- groups of attributes as foreign key reference are currently not supported
- ...

### Supported SQL data types

- binary
- binary varying
- binary large object
- numeric
- decimal
- smallint
- integer
- int
- bigint
- character
- char
- character varying
- character large object
- varchar
- float
- real
- double precision
- boolean
- date
- time

See the mapping file (`src/components/sqldatatype2xmlschema.json`) for their respective XMLSchema mapping

### N-ary relations

- currently only binary relations are supported
